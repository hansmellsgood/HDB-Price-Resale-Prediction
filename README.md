# HDB Resale Price Prediction
HDB Resale Price Predicion

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/teyang/singapore-hdb-flat-resale-prices-19902020

I have explored the 2007 dataset found in kaggle
and implemented a price prediction using regression model and gotten an accuracy of 0.91 with Decision Tree Regressor.

I then created the front end application to allow the user to have easy accessbility and also created a server using flask api.
Finally, I deployed the model into an AWS EC2 instance. 

Technology used:
- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Flask
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- AWS EC2
